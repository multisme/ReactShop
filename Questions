I would say the thing i have been the most proud of technically was my raytracer in C. It was my first big project and i worked alone on the V1.
Professionally it is to have made the jump to computer science and succeded in working it.
If i had a timebackMachine, i would have studied either physics or computer science in College.
I would advise to experiment. Try a lot of things and find what stick. Start that idea in your head and try to finish it.
I don't use websites, i use man. Without jocking i tend to avoid mediums kinf of blogs, I use stackoverflow but try to only use explained answer. Else there is always the documentation of the library, and when i feel super hardcore, i go on github
Currently, my favorite one is rust. I like the fact that the compilator helps me write better code. I don't feel overwhemeld like the gcc compilator.
I don't have a least favorite one. Although i loathe unity.
What i hate the most is when you do something in code and it takes 5min in the freaking interface so you end up watching video to progress but people are talking insanely slow. (I'm looking at you unity) 
My two favotite books: Dune and Bel ami
I don't have a favorite song but my last favorite song was honey from robyn
